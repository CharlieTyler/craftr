Dear customer,

Your CRAFTR order has been successfully placed!

What happens now?
  We get in touch with our partner distilleries and tell them about your order
  They pick your bottles from their own stock, held at their distillery
  They send it straight to you!

What did I order again?
For your records, here's what you went for:

  <% @order.sold_items.each do |si| %>
    <%= "#{si.quantity} * #{si.product.name}, #{number_to_currency((si.total_paid / 100).to_f, unit: '£')}" %>
  <% end %>
  Delivery: <%= number_to_currency((@order.paid_shipping_price / 100).to_f, unit: '£') %>

Best wishes,
The CRAFTR team
